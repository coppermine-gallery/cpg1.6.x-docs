<p>Reading the FAQ is a good idea when trying to troubleshoot particular
 issues. However, it doesn't make the rest of the documentation obsolete
 - if you can't find an answer here, make sure to have read the <strong>entire</strong> documentation. Search the support board thoroughly before starting a new support request on the forum.</p>

    <a id="WhatIsGD"></a>
    <h3>What's <strong>GD</strong> and how can I get it?<a href="#WhatIsGD" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h3>
    <p><img class="imgr" src="../images/gd.png" alt="" title="GD" width="148" height="93">GD is a graphical library which enables PHP to do image manipulation. The library was originally developed by <a href="http://www.boutell.com/" rel="external" class="external">Thomas Boutell</a> and is now maintained by <a href="http://blog.thepimp.net/" rel="external" class="external">Pierre-A. Joye</a> under the umbrella of <a href="http://www.php.net/" rel="external" class="phpnet">PHP.net</a>. If you are running your own webserver you can download it at <a href="http://libgd.org/" class="external">libgd.org</a>.
 You will need to recompile PHP on (L)Unix systems, depending on your 
setup Apache as well. Most recent versions of PHP come with GD - go for a
 package. On most windows systems, you can just enable it in the php.ini
 file. If you are subscribing to a webhost: find out through your 
webhost if GD/GD2 support is available on your site. If not, ask your 
webhost if you can have it or find yourself another webhost. GD/GD2 are 
pretty much a standard feature at most webhosting services.<br></p><hr>

    <a id="whatIsImageMagick"></a>
    <h3>What's ImageMagick and how can I get it?<a href="#whatIsImageMagick" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h3>
    <p><img class="imgr" src="../images/imagemagick.png" alt="" title="ImageMagick" width="130" height="54">ImageMagick
 is another graphical library like GD/GD2 for image manipulation. If you
 are running your own webserver, you can download it at <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org" class="external">imagemagick.org</a>.
 There are sources available for Unix, Linux, Mac and Windows 
executables, as well as binary packages for various server operating 
systems. You cannot install ImageMagick if you are subscribing to a 
webhost.

    <a id="enableGD"></a>
    <h3>How do I <strong>enable GD</strong> on my Windows server?<a href="#enableGD" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h3>
    <p>GD 1.x 2.x are normally part of all standard PHP distributions under Windows<br>
    To check if you have it, go to the directory where you installed 
PHP, go to the "extensions" subdir and see if you have a file named 
"php_gd2.dll".<br>
    Occasionally, you will also need to edit your php.ini file (located 
in windows directory normally) and remove the ";" that is at the 
beginning of the line:<br>
    <span class="code">extension=php_gd2.dll</span> (at the end of the file). This will cause PHP to load the GD2 extension.<br>
    Whenever you make changes to php.ini, remember that you will need to restart your webserver before changes become effective.<br>
    ImageMagick it quite complicated to use under Windows<br>

    <p>Side-note: the Coppermine Dev team does not recommend <a href="requirements.htm#what_minimum_self-hosting">self-hosting</a>.
 We are not trying to encourage you to run a webserver on your own if 
you don't know your way around. We left this paragraph in the FAQ 
section for reference. Please understand that we can not advise on 
webserver setup issues.</p><hr>
    <a id="enableIMonWindows"></a>
    <h3>How do I <strong>enable ImageMagick</strong> on my Windows server?<a href="#enableIMonWindows" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h3>
    <p>ImageMagick is quite complicated to set up on Windows. There are 
several things to be taken into account. The Coppermine support board is
 <strong>not</strong> the right place to ask for help on installing it, 
as it deals with Coppermine, not "How to set up a server" (most people 
on the Coppermine boards don't run their own webserver, but they have 
webspace by a webhost). Instead, try to find support boards on the 
internet that deal with this special topic.</p>
    <p>The path to ImageMagick mustn't contain spaces or special 
characters. You have to make sure that the user the webserver runs under
 actually has the needed permissions to run the ImageMagick executables.</p>

    <a id="installIMwhenHosted"></a>
    <h3>How can I <strong>install ImageMagick or GD</strong>?<a href="#installIMwhenHosted" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h3>
    <p>You can only <a href="#enableIMonWindows">install ImageMagic or GD if you're running your own server</a>
 or if you have at least shell access to your webserver. If your site is
 being hosted by a webhost you can only contact your webhost and ask 
them to install it for you. If they refuse choose another webhost or use
 GD instead.<br></p>

<a id="VersionPHP"></a>
<h2>How do I find out <strong>which version of PHP</strong> I have?<a href="#VersionPHP" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h2>
<p>If you haven't installed Coppermine, yet, create a blank file named "info.php". Add the following code to it: <span class="code">&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;</span>.
 Save the file and upload it to your webserver, then run it in your 
browser (e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/info.php). The very first line 
should read "PHP Version X.Y.Z"<br>Please note: leaving info.php on your
 server could be a security risk; either delete it after use or move it 
into a password protected directory!<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have already 
installed Coppermine, you will find a phpinfo file (phpinfo.php) within 
the coppermine folder. Log in to your Coppermine setup as the admin and 
simply point (type in the URL) your browser to 
http://yourdomain.tld/your_coppermine_folder/phpinfo.php or click on the
 phpinfo link in Coppermine's <a href="admin_menu.htm">admin menu</a>.</p><hr>

<a id="InstallSteps"></a>
<h2>What are the <strong>steps</strong> to get Coppermine running?<a href="#InstallSteps" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" alt="" width="15" height="9"></a></h2>
<p>as stated in the <a href="install.htm#how">install section</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download Coppermine</li>
<li>Unzip it to your harddrive</li>
<li>Upload the contents of the coppermine folder to your server (you can
 install it in the root or in a unique folder with a name of your 
choosing).</li>
<li>CHMOD (<u>CH</u>ange permission settings <u>MOD</u>e) your newly 
uploaded Coppermine "include" and "albums" folders and subfolders to 
allow for read/write access. If your webhost does not provide file 
management tools to let you do this, you will probably need to search 
the net, download and install an FTP program to facilitate this.<br>
For details, read the <a href="install_permissions.htm#permissions">permission section</a>.</li>
<li> Create a database with your website management tools if you don't 
already have one. You do not have to add any tables to your newly 
created database. Coppermine will create them for you. If you already 
have a database on your site, Coppermine can use that as well. </li>
<li>If you are installing on a Yahoo Webserver, <a href="http://coppermine-gallery.net/forum/index.php?topic=18943.0">read this thread first</a>.</li>
<li>Point your browser to http://www.yoursite.com/coppermine/install.php
 and follow the directions of the install file (basically the 
mySQL-tables will be created there and the config table will be filled 
with default values)</li>
<li>Upon successful installation, you can delete the install.php file 
from your website, but you don't have to, as Coppermine makes sure that 
the installer is not being run a second time.</li>
<li>Point your browser to http://www.yoursite.com/coppermine/ , and 
login as admin using the ID and Password you provided during install. 
With admin controls turned on, click on the CONFIG menu button to start 
customizing your Coppermine Photo Gallery as suggested in the "<a href="start.htm">getting started</a>" section of the docs.</li>
<li>Experiment with your new install, create a few <a href="categories.htm">categories</a>, sub-categories, and <a href="albums.htm">albums</a>. Upload a few pics (not too many, just yet), test if everything works. </li>
<li>Point your browser to http://www.yoursite.com/coppermine/docs/ and 
READ the docs. The documents included with CPG1.5.x have been updated 
from previous versions to help answer your questions and issues so that 
you can get the site you want the first time out. Reading the docs takes
 but a few minutes. Resolving issues after the fact can take days, even 
weeks.</li>
<li>If your new Coppermine install is in a sub folder on your site, publish your site by linking it to your homepage.</li>

<a id="installFTP_mode"></a>
<h2>What <strong>FTP mode</strong> should I use?</h2>
<p>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is used to exchange and manipulate files
 over a computer network. An FTP client may connect to an FTP server to 
manipulate files on that server.</p>
<p>There are two different transfer modes in <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr>. Please use binary mode for all files, as using ASCII or auto mode may result in unexpected behavior when using the <a href="upgrading.htm#versioncheck">versioncheck</a>.</p>
<p>For more information consult the manual for your <a href="dev_tools.htm#dev_tools_ftp_client">FTP client</a> or read up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" rel="external" class="external">the Wikipedia article on FTP</a>.</p>
